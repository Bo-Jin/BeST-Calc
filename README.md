# Butler equation suface tension calculation for binary solution alloys
Pls prepare your thermodynamic database and the description of molar volume that is in temperature-dependent polynomial or in CALPHAD-type database based on the linear thermal expansion.
Also, you need the expression of surface tension for pure elements.
Then you can get the surface tension for binary solution alloys.
In addition, you can consider the size effect for surface tension. 
There are three models for size effect on the surface tension.
Also, you can choose the Pycalphad to calculate the partial excess molar Gibbs energy, which require you to install the Pycalphad first in your PC.
Pls enjoy this code.
BTW, if you have some problems pls do not hesitate to contact me.
